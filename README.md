## How to setup locally
### Requirements
- Docker must be installed and running

1. Copy '.env.sample' and rename it as '.env'
2. Edit `.env' to fill in the environmental variables.
3. Start Docker and run `docker-compose up --build` (If developing, always run with `--build`. the `--build` tag creates new images with code changes reflected).
4. Delete dangling images from your docker images repository.
